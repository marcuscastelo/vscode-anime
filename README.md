# Marucs' Anime VSCode Extension

A personal project used to facilitate my daily task of registering when I watched certain anime episode in a plain-text list.
## Features

This extension provides syntax highlighting, syntax checking, field autocompletion and keybinds based on ANL rules and features. 

### Syntax Highlighting

Here is a simple example:
## TODO: change image size and include friend example
![syntax example](images/syntax-example.png)

Dates are in orange, anime titles in green, watch times in blue, episodes in cyan and friends in yellow.

### WIP: autocompletion

### Keybinds

`Alt + D` - inserts current date (dd/mm/yyyy) below the cursor
`Alt + T` - inserts current time (mm:ss) below the cursor
`Alt + N` - inserts current anime's next episode (last episode + 1)
